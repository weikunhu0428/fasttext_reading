fastText is on par with deep learning classifiers in terms of accuary, and many orders of magnitude faster for training and evaluation.The fastText model could be trained in less than ten mins with more tha none billion words using a standard multicore CPU, and classify half a million sentences among 312 K classes in less than a minutes.Text Classifiction is an important task in Natural Language Processing. Linear classifiers are considered as strong baselines for text classifcation problem, which could reach high performance if right features are selected. Downside for the exsiting models are slwo and scale to large corpus.
